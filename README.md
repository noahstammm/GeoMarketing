# PawsPlace Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook is designed to help dog owners plan their walks with their pets by determining the best walking routes based on user inputs. The notebook interacts with the user to get the desired address and the maximum duration for the walk, then calculates and displays the best routes using geographical data.

## Contents

1. **Input Section**
   - Asks for the address where the walk should start.
   - Asks for the maximum duration of the walk.

2. **Processing Section**
   - Processes the user inputs to determine the optimal walking routes.
   - Utilizes mapping and geographical data to display these routes.

3. **Output Section**
   - Displays the best route for the user and their pet.
   - Includes an evaluation and summary of the results.

## Detailed Description
